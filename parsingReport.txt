We created lists for all five of the different categories; movies, stars, genres, genres in movies and stars in movies. We also created Map objects for each list so that we could check for duplicates in O(1) complexity time. This allowed us to greatly increase the speed at which we were able to parse through the data and keep us from iterating through entire lists to check for duplicates.
